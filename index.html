    <h3>Joe's looking for a special someone who:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>enjoys time with friends</li>
        <li>loves fine dining</li>
        <li></li>

    <h3>The Perfect Date</h3>
    <p>
      ...begins with a walk (or run) in the park.  Maybe even a couple rounds (or hours?) of fetch.  And a picnic lunch with gourmet Milkbones for desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having fun at the park, then it's off to Paris on Joe's personal flying doghouse for sightseeing and dinner at Versailles.
